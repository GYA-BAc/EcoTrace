# An Environmentally-Focused Social Media Platform.
Scan your recycling to learn how to properly dispose of it! Then post pictures of your recycling to encourage others to do the same.

## Functionality

### AI Integration
The app offers several AI features:
 - Image Recognition is used to scan uploaded photos
 - ChatGPT is then used to tell the user how to dispose of recycling
 - ChatGPT is also used to moderate the social media function

## Try It
Unfortunately, since the app requires a ChatGPT API token (and this is a personal project), we do not have a public release of the app.
If you want to try it on your own machine:
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a file named ".env" at the base of the repository
3. Insert the following line: 
<pre>
REACT_APP_API_KEY="Your Token Goes Here"
</pre>
4. Run:
<pre>
npm start
</pre>
